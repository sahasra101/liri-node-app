* allows the user to use Gitbash or Terminal to search the Spotify directory of music for information about a song

## Overview of the organization of the app and how to use it
* the coding is written in a way that the commands are written after the js file name followed by the user query.
* for example: if the user wants to search Spotify for a track, the user would use the command spotify-this-song.
* similarly if the user wants to search for movie rated info, the user would type movie-this followed by the movie name.
* if the user wanted to search for live music performances by a band, the user would type concert-this followed by the band name.
